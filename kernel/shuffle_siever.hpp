   ShuffleSiever. This class realises the necklace sieving algorithm described
in:

   Quantum Algorithms for the Approximate k-List Problem and Their Application
to Lattice Sieving,
   Elena Kirshanova, Erik MÃ¥rtensson, Eamonn W. Postlethwaite, and Subhayan Roy
Moulik, Asiacrypt 2019, https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/1016, Algorithm 7.1, and
(in spirit) the Ducas-Kirchner ring sieve described in,
   https://eurocrypt.iacr.org/2018/Slides/Monday/TrackB/01-01.pdf, slide 22.

   Essentially, the idea is to shuffle vectors around a ring, at each step
applying some reduction. There are some minor differences between the strategies
(i.e whether the vectors are only shifted in one direction, or if they flow back
and forth between two nodes).

   It turns out that this sieving strategy maps quite nicely to distributed
hardware: the "flow" allows one to use non-blocking calls, which allows hardware
to be theoretically fully saturated.
